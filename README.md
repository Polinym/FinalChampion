This is the martial arts RPG project that I created in a team with Daniel Ma and Tyler Stratton. The objective was to create an appealing role-playing game based on real-world martial arts, but in a sci-fi setting. We only had 6 months to develop this game, so the end result is mostly a demo. The demo does feature most of the game mechanics that would have appeared had this been a full-fledged release.

The source code for this game is included for review only. I do not permit the editing or redistributing of this game without permission from me or those involved. Graphical assets have been removed from the source code so as to protect my intellectual property.

See this video for demonstration of the game's story mode:
